## Development Tools and Platforms

In this section, I can provide an overview of the tools and platforms I used during the development of the project. I'll explain their purpose and how they contributed to the development process.

### Vue CLI

I used Vue CLI to scaffold and manage the Vue.js project. Vue CLI provides a set of helpful commands and a standardized project structure, making it easier to develop, build, and deploy the application.

### CSS Framework - Tailwind CSS

I integrated Tailwind CSS as the chosen CSS framework. Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach, allowing me to rapidly build and style components using a set of responsive utility classes.

### Code Editor - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

I developed the project using Visual Studio Code, a versatile code editor with features such as integrated version control, debugging, and extensions that enhance productivity.

### Image Sources

I sourced images from various online platforms, including Google Images. Please note that these images are used for demonstration purposes only and may be subject to copyright and usage restrictions. Proper attribution and compliance with licensing terms have been ensured.

### Version Control - Git

Git played a crucial role in my development workflow. I used Git for version control, allowing me to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage codebase versions effectively.
